## Overview

This project is a web application built with Next.js that displays various statistics and charts. Users can filter the displayed data by category through a select input, and interact with the charts to further filter the data.

## Features

2. **Data Display**: Three cards display key statistics.
3. **Interactive Charts**: Charts are updated based on the selected category and allow further filtering when elements like bars or circles are clicked.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tremor (for charts)
- Styled Components (for styling)
- Tailwind (for charts styling)
- Jest (for unit testing)
- Testing Library (for UI testing)
- Cypress (for E2E testing)
